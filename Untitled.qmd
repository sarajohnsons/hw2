# Using hist to create a histogram of the scores
hist(rst$SCORE)
# Most scores are distributed to the right and are very high

#2. Some restaurants have been in business much longer than others. # is there any trend in terms of how highly older vs. newer # restaurants score on their inspections?


#Using gg plot and giving the columns of dataset I want to visualize 
ggplot(rst, aes(x = RESTAURANTOPENDATE, y = SCORE)) +

```{r}
#This histogram shows that there is no significant trend in how #highly older vs. newer restuarant's score. The scores are very high #from the left to the right, but there is a slight difference as the #right, has some lower scores (one close to 0) & some estimatedly in #the 80s.

#3. Wake County is the most populous county in North Carolina, and #there are many cities in it. Do the inspection scores vary by city? #Note that the city column contains some differently spelled city #names; make sure to clean those up so that there is only one #estimated value per city. The recode function that we used for #creating a weekend/weekday variable in the SFpark exercise will be #useful here, and you may also be interested in the str_to_upper #function. 
#Make these upper case so theyre uniform 
rst$CITY <- str_to_upper(rst$CITY)
#Some had spelling mistakes or were the same city just named differently so this fixes it 
rst$CITY <- recode(rst$CITY,

#The inspection scores do vary slightly by city. Even though Wake #County is the most populous city, it does not have the highest #inspection score.

```{r}
#4. Wake County employs a whole team of inspectors. It is possible #that some inspectors may be more thorough than others. Do #inspection scores vary by inspector? 
#Making this only Wake Forest 
wake <- filter(rst, CITY == "WAKE FOREST")
#Grouping by inspector so we can see their specific scores
wakeinspect <- summarize(group_by(wake, INSPECTOR), avg_score = mean(SCORE, na.rm = TRUE))
wakeinspect
#Yes, the scores do differ based on inspector. No 2 inspectors have #the same exact score given. They are very close in score except #Lisa McCoy who has the lowest.
```

```{r}
#5. It is possible that some extreme results from the previous #questions are due to small sample sizes in a particular city, for a #particular inspector, or in a particular time period. Look at the #sample sizes in each of your groups. Do you think this is an #explanation for the results you came to above?

#Number of sample size of only wake, for the bigger dataset rst i just looked to the right in Environment and saw the sample size  
wakesamplesize <- dim(wake)
wakesamplesize

#The sample size for just Wake Forest is 185 which is much smaller #than the original sample size of all the cities which was 3064 #after excluding NAs.
```

```{r}
#6. The data file contains records for many types of food-service #facility (e.g.Â restaurants, food trucks, etc.). Are the scores for #restaurants higher than other types of facility?

#Group by type so we can see scores of all of them

typeof <- summarize(group_by(rst, FACILITYTYPE),avg_score = mean(SCORE, na.rm = TRUE))

typeof

#The scores for restaurants not higher than any of the other types #of facilities, they are the lowest out of all the types. 
```

```{r}
#3. Since restaurants are where the general public is most likely to #interact with the food-service system, Wake County Public Health is #particularly interested in sanitation in restaurants. Repeat the #analyses above (1-5) for restaurants specifically.

#Filtering all data to only Restaurants
rest <- filter(rst, FACILITYTYPE == "Restaurant")
rest

#Histogram to look at scores
hist(rest$SCORE)
#Most are very high and fall into 80-100

#Trends in when they opened
ggplot(rest, aes(x = RESTAURANTOPENDATE, y = SCORE)) +
  geom_point() 
#Again I see that there is not much of a difference, but a slight #lower score towards right

#Looking at average score for just restuarants
restsc<- summarize(group_by(rest, CITY), avg_score = mean(SCORE, na.rm = TRUE))
restsc

#Finding inspector scores for just these observations
restinspect <- summarize(group_by(rest, INSPECTOR), avg_score = mean(SCORE, na.rm = TRUE))
restinspect

# Looking at the right in my environment, I see I have 2044 observations of 12 variables when before I had 3064 when I was looking at all typed. So this may effect study, although 2044 is still large.
